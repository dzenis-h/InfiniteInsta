## Overview 📖
InfiniteInsta is a React, Node & Unsplash Infinite Scroll Challenge. It reaches out to the Unsplash API and fetches images continuously with an infinite scroll feature. This project is part of a coding challenge which you can find [here](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/code-challenge-16-infinite-scroll-unsplash-gallery).

## Quick Start 🚀
To get started with InfiniteInsta, you need to install both Node and React dependencies. To install Node dependencies, navigate to the root folder of the project and run `npm i`. To install React dependencies, navigate to the `client` folder and run `npm i`.

Also make sure to do the following:

Go into `config/server` and add your own API keys for Unsplash.

Run both server & client with a single command:
```
npm run dev
```
